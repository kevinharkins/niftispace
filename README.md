# niftispace
A simple set classes to read/write nifti files from Matlab 

* niftifile.m — a Matlab class that reads and writes *.nii files. 
* niftispace.m — a class that can read/write any *.nii file in a directory as a Matlab struct-like object 

# Issues

* It is up to the user to set the nifti orientation correctly
* Only nifti-1 files are currently supported
* Only .nii files are currently supported
